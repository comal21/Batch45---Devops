## Important Git Commands

Here are some important Git commands and their brief explanations:

1. **`git init`**
   - Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **`git clone`**
   - Copies a repository from a remote source (like GitHub) to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. **`git add`**
   - Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area for the next commit.

   ```bash
   git add <file>
   ```

4. **`git commit`**
   - Records changes in the repository with a message describing the changes.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

5. **`git status`**
   - Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

6. **`git diff`**
   - Shows the differences between the working directory and the latest commit.

   ```bash
   git diff
   ```

7. **`git log`**
   - Displays a log of commits, showing commit messages, authors, dates, and commit hashes.

   ```bash
   git log
   ```

8. **`git branch`**
   - Lists existing branches or creates a new branch.

   ```bash
   git branch          # List branches
   git branch <branch_name>   # Create a new branch
   ```

9. **`git checkout`**
   - Switches to a different branch or restores working files from a specific commit.

   ```bash
   git checkout <branch_name>   # Switch to a branch
   git checkout -b <new_branch>   # Create and switch to a new branch
   ```

10. **`git merge`**
    - Combines changes from different branches.

    ```bash
    git merge <branch_name>
    ```

11. **`git pull`**
    - Fetches changes from a remote repository and integrates them into the current branch.

    ```bash
    git pull origin <branch_name>
    ```

12. **`git push`**
    - Uploads local branch commits to the remote repository.

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch_name>
    ```

13. **`git remote`**
    - Lists remote repositories that are connected to your local repository.

    ```bash
    git remote -v   # Show remote repositories with URLs
    ```

14. **`git fetch`**
    - Downloads changes from a remote repository without merging them into your working branch.

    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    ```

15. **`git reset`**
    - Resets the current branch to a specific commit, optionally preserving changes in the working directory.

    ```bash
    git reset --hard <commit_hash>
    ```

These are just a few fundamental Git commands. There are many more, each serving different purposes in the version control process.
